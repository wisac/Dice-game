**DICE GAME**<br>
A simple Javascript dice rolling game for practicing my DOM manipulation
<br>
**GAME RULES**<br>
The game is made up of two players.
When a player roll the dice, the number rolled is stored as current score of the player. The player would decide to either keep on rolling the dice or *hold* the current score and give the other player the chance to also play.

A player can decide to keep playing multiple times in a row without holding current score **BUT risk ***losing all the points in the current score*** if he/she rolles the `number 1`**. 

When a player rolls 1, the other player's turn to play the game.
To **win the game**, a player must accumulate a **total score of 100** or more.
Keep playing!
<br>


**HOW TO PLAY**<br>
PLAYER 1 is active by default. If you want Player 2 to start the game, Hold the score(0) on game start.

1. Active Player roll the dice by clicking on `ROLL DICE` button
2. Active Player roll again or Hold score by clicking on `HOLD` button and Active Player will switch to the other Player.
3. New Active Player roll dice and decide to Hold or keep rolling
